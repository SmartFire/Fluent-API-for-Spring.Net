Fluent Spring Configuration for .Net
====================================

Welcome to the Fluent Spring API for Spring.Net!

That's correct, a fluent API to configure your spring.net IoC container. 
This library is an extension to spring.net and works in conjunction 
with the current spring.framework versions 1.3.0 and 1.3.1.

Because it is an extension, any xml configuration will still be loaded by the spring framework.

How to use it
=============

Check wiki pages on github for more information.

How to build
============

If you've branched the source and want to contribute you can do one or two things:

	Ruby, 
	Albacore gem (gem install albacore)
