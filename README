Fluent Spring Configuration for .Net
====================================

Welcome to the Fluent Spring API for Spring.Net!

That's correct, a fluent API to configure your spring.net IoC container. 
This library is an extension to spring.net and works in conjunction 
with the current spring.framework versions 1.3.0 and 1.3.1.

Because it is an extension, any xml configuration will still be loaded by the spring framework.

How to build
============


build FluentSpring.sln solution file from VS

or

execute rake from /build folder.
(pre-requisites for rake: 
	IronRuby, 
	Ruby, 
	Albacore gem (gem install albacore)
	NUnit bin folder in PATH
	NCover installed
	NuPack installed)
